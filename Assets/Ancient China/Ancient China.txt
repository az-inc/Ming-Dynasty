The Ancient China package is a compilation of architectural models and
some props for making a credible ancient chinese town.
All models have hand made 2nd UV channel for lightmaps. I don't recommend
using "Generate Lightmaps UVs" because the lightmap seams are more obvious 
and less optimized.
This package uses some Nobiax Free packages I have already published on 
Asset Store. Feel free to download and use them all :)


This package includes: 


- Buildings: 4 detailed houses (with 3 LOD) and a detailed Taoist pavilion (4 LOD).
A Castle model and 39 Great Wall sections to be used as background props (not
detailed, no LOD).

- Nobiax free assets, some textures and plants taken from packages I have already 
published on Asset Store.

- Some props with LOD.

- Trees generated using Nobiax textures and Unity tree system.

- The demo scene.

*please note that nearly all models are available in different mesh
complexity versions, and have a LODed prefab in case you have 
Unity Pro. Also note that some lowest LOD meshes are meant to be seen from
the distance, should not be considered as low poly meshes for close views.

How to use.

- Houses and Pavilion. Use the prefabs from buildings/prefabs, with the desired 
LOD or the "LODed" model if you use Unity Pro.

- For the Great Wall prefabs (buildings/prefabs/Great Wall) you can choose make 
your own design chosing from 39 different wall shapes, or use one of the provided 
long sections named "greatwall_comp1" and "greatwall_comp2".
The best way to use them, is place them on a terrain and then make the terrain shape 
fit with the wall design.

 
- For the props, chose a "LODed" prefabs from props/prefabs or chose any LOD from 
props/meshes.

- To use the trees, you can either place them in your scene or use the Unity Terrain 
system.
